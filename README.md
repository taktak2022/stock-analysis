Module 2 Green Stocks VBA Macro Lesson

# STOCK ANALYSIS USING EXCEL MACROS & VBA CODE

The purpose of this project was to gain knowledge of macros and visual basic.  Using stock information from years 2017 and 2018, the goal was to determine which stocks were the most viable for an investment.  In so doing, we gained knowledge of concepts and syntax within macros and the visual basic language.

###CONCEPTS
Building on concepts we learned in Module 1, we furthered our knowledge in the following:
  -For Next loops
  -If Then statements
  -creating arrays and indexes
 
 ###SYNTAX AND OTHER VERBIAGE
 Also building on syntax we learned in Module 1, we furthered knowledge of the following:
  -dim
  -ranges
  -value
  -formatting in Visual Basic
  -refactoring
 
 ##RESULTS
 By utilizing macros and calculating the stock information for 2017 and 2018, it clearly shows that certain stocks had more profitable investment returns in 2017 as compared to year 2018.  Most of the stocks in 2018 had a negative return percentage.  This information would be immensely for Steve, his parents and other potential investors.

By learning about this code and the latter refactoring of the original code, I learned the code performance could be improved by almost a full second of computing time.  In the grand scheme of things this may seem insignificant, however it could play a big part with more complicated and/or longer code structures.

##SUMMARY
If I were a programmer with up to a decade of experience, I would appreciate a cleaner, more well-organized (aka refactored) code should I need to work on it in any way.  It would be easier to be read and possibly adjusted, manipulated and corrected as needed.  As it stands now, I can honestly say I do not have the wealth of knowledge to make that determination.  The refactoring portion of this lesson, although I understand the logistic need for it in concept, was both tedious and painful with many hours trying to figure out the actual "wording" fo the code as well as fixing the errors that came with the fatigue of staring at code for hours on end.  A few examples were just placing the wrong character; an "+" where an "=" should go or misspelled "valeu" which should have been "value" that stopped the code from running.  Optimistically speaking I am hopeful these errors will help me become a better programmer in the end or at the very least be able to identify these types of errors so as to not repeat them.  As the old axiom goes, "It's ok to make mistakes...just don't make the same mistake twice."
